provider "aws" {

}

resource "aws_instance" "example" {
    ami = var.ami_id
    instance_type = var.instance_type
    count = var.instance_count

    tags = {
    
    Name = "${var.instance_name}-${count.index + 1}"
  }
}
----------
  ami_id = "ami-04f167a56786e4b09"
instance_type = "t2.micro"
instance_name = "prod"
instance_count = 2

  -------
  variable "instance_type" {
  description = "ec2-instance-variable"
  type = string
}

variable "ami_id" {
  description = "ami-value"
  type = string
}

variable "instance_name" {
    type = string 
    description = "name-tag-for-instance"
}

variable "instance_count" {
  description = "create2-ec2-instance-identical"
  type = number
}


above example instance was already created now we have variablize the tag name with count index = 1 means it will create two instance with qa-1 & qa-2 and delete exising instance
make sure to use variable as number when we deal with count
