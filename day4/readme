dyanamic block:
see if we want to repeat the block like ingress rule within sg again and again so we use dynamic block instead of writing the 
same thing multiple times....it works like a loop inside a resource it saves time and make the code cleaner.
so besically it genrates nested block inside a resource and it uses for_each for loop









data block:
a data block besically read and fetch information about existing resource in terraform which is u know not created or managed 
by terraform it is something created manually on aws console\
like vpc 
like sg
like subnet



what is terraform validate:
terraform validate command is used to check your terraform code for syntax errors and makes sure its valid and well formed
its like a grammer checker
syntex error , typo .

what is terraform fmt:
this is we use for correct indentation like to correct the spacebar so that our code look good.

terraform graph:






terraform taint:
terraform taint command we use to mark a specific resource for recreation during the next apply
so besically we tell the terraform that the resource is not right so instead of modifying this resource first destroy
it and recreate it.
u know the resource is in bad condition so instead of modifying them we forcefully recreate them

terraform taint aws_instance.my_instance     
terraform taint aws_sg.demo_sg 
anything 
terraform untaint aws_instance.my_instance
